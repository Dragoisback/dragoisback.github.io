## ‚úçÔ∏è How to Add or Update Content

Managing the glossary content is simple and requires no coding knowledge. All data is stored in the `content/` folder.

1.  **Navigate to the `content` folder** in this repository.
2.  **Add or Edit Files**: You can either edit the existing `data1.json`, `data2.json`, etc., files or add new ones (e.g., `data3.json`). The system will automatically load all files named `data*.json` in numerical order.
3.  **Follow the JSON Format**: Each entry in the JSON files must follow this exact format:
    ```json
    {
      "chinese": "Ê≠¶Âô®ÊîªÂáª",
      "english": "weapon attack",
      "novel": "Start with a Core Cabin"
    }
    ```
4.  **Commit Your Changes**: After adding or editing the files, save (or "commit") your changes. GitHub Pages will automatically rebuild your website with the new content within a minute or two.
